# Welcome to the Orcish API

The Orcish API is a powerful RESTful API built with the Hono framework, using Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL. Manage your orcish warriors and their legendary weapons with ease.

## Quick Start

All API endpoints are prefixed with `/api`:

```
GET /api/users    # List all users
GET /api/items    # List all items
```

## Getting Started

The Orcish API provides endpoints for managing:

- **Users** - Orcish warriors and clan members
- **Items** - Weapons, armor, and consumables

## Example Request

Create a new orcish warrior:

```bash
curl -X POST https://orcish-api.com/api/users \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Gruk the Mighty",
    "email": "gruk@orcclan.com"
  }'
```

## Features

- **RESTful Design** - Standard HTTP methods and status codes
- **Full CRUD Operations** - Create, read, update, and delete resources
- **Partial Updates** - Update only the fields you need
- **Auto Timestamps** - Automatic `createdAt` and `updatedAt` tracking
- **Error Handling** - Comprehensive error responses with appropriate status codes

## Base URL

All endpoints are available at:

```
https://orcish-api.com/api
```

## Authentication

Currently, the Orcish API does not require authentication. All endpoints are publicly accessible.
